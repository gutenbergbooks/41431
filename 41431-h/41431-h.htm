<h3>
DOVE COTTAGE
</h3>

<p class="intro">
This was the home of Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy from December
1799 to May 1808.  When Wordsworth left the cottage for two months in
1802 on the occasion of his honeymoon he wrote "A Farewell," which
begins:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
"Farewell, thou little nook of mountain ground,<br />
Thou rocky corner in the lowest stair<br />
Of that magnificent temple which doth bound<br />
One side of our whole vale with grandeur rare;<br />
Sweet garden-orchard, eminently fair,<br />
The lovliest spot that man hath ever found,<br />
Farewell!&mdash;we leave thee to Heaven's peaceful care,<br />
Thee, and the Cottage which thou dost surround.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="intro">
De Quincey also lived at Dove Cottage from 1809-1816.  He has described
it as follows:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Let the cottage be a real cottage, in fact (for I must abide by the
actual scene), a white cottage, embowered with flowering shrubs, so
chosen as to unfold a succession of flowers upon the walls, and
clustering round the windows through all months of spring, summer, and
autumn&mdash;beginning, in fact, with May roses, and ending with jasmine.

<h3>
GRASMERE
</h3>

<p class="intro">
There are many descriptions in Dorothy Wordsworth's journal of Grasmere
and Rydal Waters of which the following extracts are typical:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
SATURDAY, 26th (December 1801)....
</p>

<p>
We walked to Rydale.  Grasmere Lake a beautiful image of stillness,
clear as glass, reflecting all things.  The wind was up, and the waters
sounding.  The lake of a rich purple, the fields a soft yellow, the
island yellowish-green, the copses red-brown, the mountains purple, the
church and buildings how quiet they were!
</p>

<p>
Sunday, 31st (January 1802)....  We walked round the two lakes.
Grasmere was very soft, and Rydale was extremely beautiful from the
western side.  Nab Scar was just topped by a cloud which, cutting it
off as high as it could be cut off, made the mountain look uncommonly
lofty.  We sate down a long time with different plans.  I always love
to walk that way, because it is the way I first came to Rydale and
Grasmere, and because our dear Coleridge did also.  When I came with
Wm., 6 and Â½ years ago, it was just at sunset.  There was a rich yellow
light on the waters, and the islands were reflected there.  To-day it
was grave and soft but not perfectly calm.

In the churchyard are the graves of Wordsworth, his wife, son,
daughter, and two children who died in infancy, as well as of his
sister Dorothy.

The old rude church, with bare, bald tower, is here;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath its shadow high-born Rotha flows;<br />
Rotha, remembering well who slumbers near,<br />

Rotha, remembering well who slumbers near.<br />

A LAKELAND WALK<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
A gate swings to! our tide hath flow'd<br />
Already from the silent road.<br />
The valley-pastures, one by one,<br />
Are threaded, quiet in the sun;<br />
And now beyond the rude stone bridge<br />
Slopes gracious up the western ridge.<br />
Its woody border, and the last<br />
Of its dark upland farms is past&mdash;<br />
Cool farms, with open-lying stores,<br />
Under their burnish'd sycamores;<br />
All past! and through the trees we glide,<br />
Emerging on the green hill-side.<br />
There climbing hangs, a far-seen sign,<br />
Our wavering, many-colour'd line;<br />
There winds, upstreaming slowly still<br />
Over the summit of the hill<br />
And now, in front, behold outspread<br />
Those upper regions we must tread!<br />
Mid hollows, and clear heathy swells,<br />
The cheerful silence of the fells.<br />
Some two hours' march with serious air,<br />
Through the deep noontide heats we fare;<br />
The red-grouse, springing at our sound,<br />
Skims, now and then, the shining ground;<br />
No life, save his and ours, intrudes<br />
Upon these breathless solitudes.<br />

DUNGEON GHYLL FORCE

<p class="intro">
This spot is the scene of the lamb's rescue described by Wordsworth in
the "Idle Shepherd-boys."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
It was a spot which you may see<br />
If ever you to Langdale go;<br />
Into a chasm a mighty block<br />
Hath fallen, and made a bridge of rock:<br />
The gulf is deep below;<br />
And, in a basin black and small,<br />
Receives a lofty waterfall.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
With staff in hand across the cleft<br />
The challenger pursued his march;<br />
And now, all eyes and feet, hath gained<br />
The middle of the arch.<br />
When list! he hears a piteous moan&mdash;<br />
Again!&mdash;his heart within him dies&mdash;<br />
His pulse is stopped, his breath is lost,<br />
He totters, pallid as a ghost,<br />
And, looking down, espies<br />
A lamb, that in the pool is pent<br />
Within that black and frightful rent.<br />

There is a power to bless<br />

<h3>
BRANTWOOD
</h3>

<p class="intro">
Brantwood was the home of John Ruskin during the latter years of his
life.  Mr W. G. Collingwood in his life of Ruskin has described the
journey to Brantwood, as it was in Ruskin's time, as follows:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
After changing and changing trains, and stopping at many a roadside
station, at last you see suddenly, over the wild undulating country,
the Coniston Old Man&mdash;maen, stone: a survival of Celtic Cumbria&mdash;and
its crags, abrupt on the left, and the lake, long and narrow, on the
right.  Across the water, tiny in the distance and quite alone amongst
forests and moors, there is Brantwood; and beyond it everything seems
uncultivated, uninhabited, except for one grey farmhouse high on the
fell, where gaps in the ragged larches show how bleak and storm-swept a
spot it is....  You drive up and down a narrow, hilly lane, catching
peeps of mountains and sunset through thick, overhanging trees; you
turn sharp up through a gate under dark firs and larches; and the
carriage stops in what seems in the twilight a sort of court&mdash;a
gravelled space, one side formed by a rough stone wall crowned with
laurels and almost precipitous coppice, the brant (or steep) wood
above, and the rest is Brantwood with a capital B.

<h3>
ULLSWATER
</h3>

<p class="intro">
On April 15th, 1802, Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy visited this
lake, and, near Gowbarrow Park, saw the daffodils which he has
described in the following poem, and she in her diary.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
I wandered lonely as a cloud<br />
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,<br />
When all at once I saw a crowd,<br />
A host of golden daffodils;<br />
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,<br />
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Continuous as the stars that shine<br />
And twinkle on the milky way,<br />
They stretched in never-ending line<br />
Along the margin of the bay:<br />
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,<br />
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
The waves beside them danced, but they<br />
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:<br />
A poet could not but be gay,<br />
In such a jocund company:<br />
I gazed&mdash;and gazed&mdash;but little thought<br />
What wealth the show to me had brought:<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
For oft, when on my couch I lie<br />
In vacant or in pensive mood,<br />
They flash upon that inward eye<br />
Which is the bliss of solitude;<br />
And then my heart with pleasure fills,<br />
And dances with the daffodils.<br />

HELVELLYN
</h3>

<p class="intro">
In the spring of 1805 a gentleman perished by losing his way on
Helvellyn.  His remains were not discovered till three months
afterwards, when they were found guarded by his dog.  Sir W. Scott
visited the Lake District later on in the same year and composed the
following poem:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
I climb'd the dark brow of mighty Helvellyn,<br />
Lakes and mountains beneath me gleam'd misty and wide;<br />
All was still, save by fits, when the eagle was yelling,<br />
And starting around me the echoes replied.<br />
On the right, Striden-edge round the Red-tarn was bending,<br />
And Catchedicam its left verge was defending,<br />
One huge nameless rock in the front was ascending,<br />
When I mark'd the sad spot where the wanderer had died.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Dark green was that spot 'mid the brown mountain-heather,<br />
Where the Pilgrim of Nature lay stretch'd in decay,<br />
Like the corpse of an outcast abandon'd to weather,<br />
Till the mountain winds wasted the tenantless clay.<br />
Not yet quite deserted, though lonely extended,<br />
For, faithful in death, his mute favourite attended,<br />
The much-loved remains of her master defended,<br />
And chased the hill-fox and the raven away.<br />

O rock and torrent, lake and hill,<br />
Halls of a home austerely still,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remote and solemn view!<br />
O valley, where the wanderer sees<br />
Beyond the towering arch of trees<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helvellyn and the blue!<br />

<p class="poem">
Great Nature! on our love was shed<br />
From thine abiding goodlihead<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Majestic fostering;<br />
We wondered, half afraid to own<br />
In hardly-conscious hearts upgrown<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So infinite a thing.<br />

<p class="poem">
Within, without, whate'er hath been,<br />
In cosmic deeps the immortal scene<br />

Live the long looks, the woodland ways,<br />
That twilight of enchanted days,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imperishable Past.<br />

DERWENTWATER
</h3>

<p class="poem">
Once more, O Derwent! to thy awful shores<br />
I come, insatiate of the accustomed sight,<br />
And, listening as the eternal torrent roars,<br />
Drink in with eye and ear a fresh delight;<br />
For I have wandered far by land and sea,<br />
In all my wanderings still remembering thee.<br />

<h3>
FRIAR'S CRAG
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
The first thing which I remember, as an event in life, was being taken
by my nurse to the brow of Friar's Crag on Derwentwater; the intense
joy mingled with awe, that I had in looking through the hollows in the
mossy roots, over the crag, into the dark lake, has associated itself
more or less with all twining roots of trees ever since.

How does the water<br />

Retreating and beating and meeting and sheeting,<br />
Delaying and straying and playing and spraying,<br />
Recoiling, turmoiling and toiling and boiling,<br />
And gleaming and streaming and steaming and beaming,<br />
And rushing and flushing and brushing and gushing,<br />
And flapping and rapping and clapping and slapping,<br />
And curling and whirling and purling and twirling,<br />
And thumping and plumping and bumping and jumping,<br />
And dashing and flashing and splashing and clashing;<br />
And so never ending, but always descending,<br />
Sounds and motions for ever and ever are blending,<br />
All at once and all o'er, with a mighty uproar,<br />
And this way the water comes down at Lodore.<br />

DERWENTWATER AND BASSENTHWAITE
</h3>

<p class="intro">
Greta Hall, which was the residence of S. T. Coleridge from 1800 to
1804 and for a short time in 1806, as well as of R. Southey from Sept.
1803 to his death in March 1843, commands a view of both these lakes.
Coleridge in a letter to Southey from Greta Hall, dated 13th April
1801, describes the situation of the house as follows:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
Behind the house is an orchard, and a small wood on a steep slope, at
the foot of which flows the river Greta, which winds round and catches
the evening lights in the front of the house.  In front we have a
giant's camp&mdash;an encamped army of tent-like mountains, which, by an
inverted arch, gives a view of another vale.  On our right the lovely
vale and the wedge-shaped lake of Bassenthwaite; and on our left
Derwentwater and Lodore in view, and the fantastic mountains of
Borrowdale.  Behind us the massy Skiddaw, smooth, green, high, with two
chasms and a tent-like ridge in the larger.  A fairer scene you have
not seen in all your wanderings.

WASTWATER<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
There is a lake hid far among the hills,<br />
That raves around the throne of solitude,<br />
Not fed by gentle streams, or playful rills,<br />
But headlong cataract and rushing flood.<br />
There gleam no lovely hues of hanging wood,<br />
No spot of sunshine lights her sullen side;<br />
For horror shaped the wild in wrathful mood,<br />
And o'er the tempest heaved the mountains' pride.<br />
</p>

SCAWFELL<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
I stood upon the mountain, whose vast brow<br />
Looks down his four concentrate vales below;<br />
Here Esk smiles coyly thro' his woody glade;<br />
There Wastdale's chaos flings its length of shade;<br />
Next in bright contrast with that gloomy vale,<br />
The life and loveliness of Borrowdale;<br />
And last, that wild and deep and swampy dell,<br />
Where Langdale's summits frown upon Bowfell.<br />

THE RIVER DUDDON<br />

<p class="poem">
Return Content! for fondly I pursued,<br />
Even when a child, the Streams&mdash;unheard, unseen;<br />
Through tangled woods, impending rocks between;<br />
Or, free as air, with flying inquest viewed<br />
The sullen reservoirs whence their bold brood&mdash;<br />
Pure as the morning, fretful, boisterous, keen,<br />
Green as the salt-sea billows, white and green&mdash;<br />
Poured down the hills, a choral multitude!<br />

Still glides the Stream, and shall for ever glide;<br />
The Form remains, the Function never dies;<br />
While we, the brave, the mighty, and the wise,<br />
We Men, who in our morn of youth defied<br />
The elements, must vanish;&mdash;be it so!<br />
Enough if something from our hands have power<br />
To live, and act, and serve the future hour;<br />
And if, as toward the silent tomb we go,<br />
Through love, through hope, and faith's transcendent dower,<br />
We feel that we are greater than we know.<br />
